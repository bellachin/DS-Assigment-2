    "The average birth weight of babies whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy and did not have a history of hypertension is 6 pounds and 13.01 ounces. Comparatively, mothers who smoked had a average birth weight of 6 pounds and 1.78 ounces, mothers who had a history of hypertension had a average birth weight of 5 pounds and 9.48 ounces, and mothers who smoked and had a history of hypertension had a average birth weight of 5 pounds and 10.34 ounces. This displays that babies whose mothers smoked during pregnancy would have lower average birth weights compared to those who did not smoke. Additionally, the presence of hypertension both with and without smoking has a lower birth weight than those who did not smoke. This analysis reveals that both smoking and hypertension negatively impact birth weight."
