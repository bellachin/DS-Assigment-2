## Assignment Description
This assignment involves analyzing maternal health and infant birth weight data to explore the impact of various risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, and premature births. The analysis is performed using Python, specifically leveraging the NumPy library for numerical computations and data filtering. The assignment tasks include calculating descriptive statistics, filtering data based on conditions, and developing a custom function to convert birth weight from grams to pounds and ounces. Additionally, reusable helper functions are implemented to streamline the statistical analysis of different subsets of the dataset. Through this assignment, patterns and insights into birth weight variations based on maternal factors are identified and discussed.
